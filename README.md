Dead simple tavern name generator for TTRPGs.

This is a simple website to create random names for taverns for your TTRPG games. It works best for medieval fantasy settings, but feel free to use it for any other setting. Should do just fine. The repository name is the name of the tavern my D&D group chose for their own establishment, which I liked a lot!

The project is made using Vite`s React + SWC + TS template, with no additional libraries. All styling is made through CSS Modules using the BEM methodology.
